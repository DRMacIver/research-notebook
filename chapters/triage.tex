\chapter{Paper Triage}

This is a working set of papers that might be worth reading.

Typical process for finding these papers is to pick a paper I know is good and go through the list of papers that cite it.

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Multi-dimensional Boltzmann Sampling of context-free Languages''\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1002-0046} is about the problem of constructing words with specific frequency distributions of letters.
I'm not very interested in this problem but it seems to have some interesting theory and referneces that would be useful for exploring this area further.
