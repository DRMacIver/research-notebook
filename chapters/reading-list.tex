\chapter{Reading List}

Some things I should get around to reading but currently haven't,
in no particular order of priority.

This is a rather crude way of bookmarking papers and books.
It's mostly to get them into the bibtex and somewhere on permanent record rather than leaving them in Browser tabs waiting to be lost.


\begin{itemize}
\item More of the work of \href{http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers.html}{Nancy Leveson}
\item The work of \href{http://mcs.open.ac.uk/hcs2/}{Helen Sharp}.
\item Dilemmas in a general theory of planning\cite{rittel1973dilemmas}.
\item Computers and language learning: An overview\cite{warschauer1998computers}
\item Nonparametric estimation of the number of classes in a population\cite{chao1984nonparametric} (probably going to be more interesting to read things that cite it, as this is quite old, but might be worth understanding the paper first).
\item Royenâ€™s proof of the Gaussian correlation inequality\cite{latala2017royen}
\item Birds of the Internet: Towards a field guide to the organization and governance of participation\cite{fish2011birds}.
\item Mechanizing exploratory game design\cite{smith2012mechanizing}.
\item Can a machine design?\cite{cross2001can}
\item A bunch of work by \href{http://www.robertfeldt.net/}{Robert Feldt} and Simon Poulding on test case generation
(oh look! Something actually relevant to my PhD!).
In particular~\cite{DBLP:conf/icst/PouldingF15, DBLP:conf/issre/FeldtP13, DBLP:conf/icse/FeldtP15}.
\item Tools for Discovery, Refinement and Generalization of Functional Properties by Enumerative Testing\cite{matela2017tools}.
\item Probabilistic DFA Inference using Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Minimality\cite{DBLP:conf/icml/ThollardDH00}
\item Inference of regular languages using state merging algorithms with search\cite{DBLP:journals/pr/BugalhoO05}.
\item Hitting Families of Schedules for Asynchronous Programs\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/ChistikovMN16}
\end{itemize}
