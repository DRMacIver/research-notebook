# A collection of research notes

This is an entirely ad hoc collection of research notes about stuff
I am reading and thinking about. It will mostly consist of paper
reviews and random notes.

Note: You don't have to read the raw LaTeX.
[PDF builds are available as releases](https://github.com/DRMacIver/research-notebook/releases).
