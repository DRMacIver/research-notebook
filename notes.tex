\maketitle

This is mostly a collection of research level material I am interested in.
It's something like a lab book,
something like a collection of papers I find interesting and want to make sure I remember and/or understand.

It is likely to be terribly organised.
It's primarily intended as a place for me to write stuff that is useful for me to have written down,
and only secondarily intended for public consumption.

It's also likely to be terribly formatted.
I'm not very good at \LaTeX.
